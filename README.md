Project 3 : CSS3 Animations

In this simple project, you’ll be breaking apart some of the popular CSS3 design modules. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles. Your job is to create a website that includes the modules described in the documentation.

Project 4 : Voter Registration

In this project, you’ll get a chance to rebuild the form6 used by nvsp.in for registering new voters. The page is very straightforward and don’t worry about any of the dynamic functionality on the page or having the form actually submit. The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can.
